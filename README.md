# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-Project
NTU SC2002 Object Oriented Design and Programming (OODP) Project

## About
This is an Object-Oriented (OO) application for a Camp Application and Management System (CAMs) project implemented in Java.
CAMs is an application for staff and students to manage, view and register for camps within NTU. The application will act as a centralized hub for all staff and students. 
The application is developed as a Command Line Interface application (non-Graphical User Interface).

## Setup Instructions (Important)
IMPORTANT: Change the content of the String in: 
<private String applicationFolderFilePath = "..\\SC2002 Project Application Folder\\csv files\\";> in the <CsvFilePaths.java> file to the file path of the "csv files" folder in your folder directory.

## File Structure
 | File Name  | Content |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CAMS assignment  | Java source code files  |
| Javadoc| Java documentation of CAMs application|
| csv files | Csv files needed for the application program. The application reads/writes/creates/deletes csv files in this folder, hence it is essential that you follow the step mentioned above for the program to function properly.  |
| Report.docx | Report of design considerations and principles|
| UML Diagram.pdf | UML diagram of CAMs application|
