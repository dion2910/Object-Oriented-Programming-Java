# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP-Project
NTU SC2002 Object Oriented Design and Programming (OODP) Project

## About
This is an Object-Oriented (OO) application for a Camp Application and Management System (CAMs) implemented in Java.
CAMs is an application for staff and students to manage, view and register for camps within NTU. The application will act as a centralized hub for all staff and students. 
The application is developed as a Command Line Interface application (non-Graphical User Interface).

## Setup Instructions (Important)
IMPORTANT: Change the content of the String in: 
<private String applicationFolderFilePath = "..\\SC2002 Project Application Folder\\csv files\\";> in the <CsvFilePaths.java> file to the file path of the "csv files" folder in your folder directory.

## File Structure
1) CAMS Assignment Folder contains the "src" folder containing all source code files, "bin" and "lib"
2) csv files folder contains .csv files needed for the application program. The application reads/writes/creates/deletes csv files in this folder, hence it is essential that you follow the step mentioned above for the program to function properly.

## Key Learning Objectives

- Applying OO Design Principles
- Model, Design and Develop an OO Application
